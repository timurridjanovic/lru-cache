#LRU Cache

**Description**:
LRU Cache implementation with min heap instead of ordereddict.
This was mainly an exercise in implementing a min heap, which is often used in priority queues.

**Run tests**:
To run the tests, you need to have nose installed. If you're on a UNIX-like system, you can run `easy_install nose` or `pip install nose` 
(you'll probably need to run these commands as root or using sudo).

Once nose is installed, you can simply run `nosetests` in the root directory of the program.
